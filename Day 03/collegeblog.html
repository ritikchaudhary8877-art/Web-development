                <b>Pollution </b> is one of the biggest environmental problems in the world today.
                It means making our surroundings dirty and harmful for living beings.
                Pollution can be of many types such as air, water, soil, and noise pollution.
                Air pollution is mainly caused by smoke from vehicles and factories, which
                makes breathing difficult and leads to many diseases. Water pollution occurs
                when harmful waste and chemicals are dumped into rivers, lakes, and oceans,
                making water unsafe for drinking and aquatic life. Soil pollution happens
                due to excessive use of pesticides, fertilizers, and plastic waste.
